1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file would be created. It is needed to create a git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where the files being stored when they are going to be committed. The working directory is where the computer currently working at. It provides a platform for gathering updates of related files to make a commit that represents a logical change.

Use "git diff" to check the changes made comparing the staging area with the working directory, and then use "git add" and "git commit -m" to commit the logical change.
